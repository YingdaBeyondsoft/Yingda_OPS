The  `object` type is an alias for <xref:System.Object> in the .NET Framework. In the unified type system of C#, all types, predefined and user-defined, reference types and value types, inherit directly or indirectly from <xref:System.Object>. You can assign values of any type to variables of type `object`. When a variable of a value type is converted to object, it is said to be *boxed*. When a variable of type object is converted to a value type, it is said to be *unboxed*. For more information, see [Boxing and Unboxing](../../../csharp/programming-guide/types/boxing-and-unboxing.md).

 The following sample shows how variables of type `object` can accept values of any data type and how variables of type `object` can use methods on <xref:System.Object> from the .NET Framework.
